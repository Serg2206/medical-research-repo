  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based diagnostics.
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for sequential medical data.
  - Transformer-based models for natural language processing in medical records.
  - Multi-task learning architectures for joint prediction tasks.
  - Easily extendable for custom architectures with modular design.
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Built-in support for handling diverse medical data formats.
- **High-Performance Training**: Optimized training loops with GPU support.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Tools**: Metrics and visualizations to assess model performance.

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

Store raw data in the `data/` directory. The raw data should be in CSV format with the following structure:

| ID   | Feature1 | Feature2 | Feature3 | Label   |
|------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| 1    | 0.5      | 1.2      | 3.4      | Healthy |
| 2    | 2.1      | 0.8      | 1.1      | Sick    |
| ...  | ...      | ...      | ...      | ...     |

Use the provided script for preprocessing:
```bash
python scripts/prepare_data.py --input data/raw_dataset.csv --output data/processed_data.csv
```

### 2. Training the Model

Train a neural network using the `train.py` script:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/train_config.json
```
#### Arguments:
- `--config`: Path to the JSON file with training configurations. This file specifies key parameters such as model type, learning rate, batch size, and training duration. Refer to the example configuration below:

Example training configuration (`configs/train_config.json`):
```json
{
  "model": "resnet50",
  "epochs": 50,
  "batch_size": 32,
  "learning_rate": 0.001,
  "optimizer": "adam",
  "loss_function": "cross_entropy",
  "metrics": ["accuracy", "precision", "recall"],
  "device": "cuda"
}
```
To modify the configuration:
1. Open `configs/train_config.json` in a text editor.
2. Adjust the values of the parameters as needed (e.g., change `model` to "transformer" or update `learning_rate`).
3. Save the file and rerun the training script.

For more examples, see `docs/config_examples.md` or the `notebooks/` directory.

### 3. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model on a test dataset:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --model models/trained_model.pth --data data/test_data.csv
```

### 4. Inference

Generate predictions using the `infer.py` script:
```bash
python infer.py --input data/new_samples.csv --model models/trained_model.pth --output results/predictions.csv
```
