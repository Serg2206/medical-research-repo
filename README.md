# Medical AI Neural Network

## Overview
This repository contains a self-learning scientific-medical neural network designed to assist in advanced medical research and decision-making. The neural network integrates with external medical knowledge bases and uses state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide insights and predictions.

## Features
- **Self-learning:** Continuously improves its performance using feedback and updated datasets.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly connects with medical knowledge bases.
- **Scalable:** Supports various medical applications, including diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and research support.
- **Customizable:** Easily adaptable to specific medical fields or datasets.

## Installation
To set up and use this neural network, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Serg2206/medical-research-repo.git
   cd medical-research-repo
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure access to medical knowledge bases:**
   - Add API keys or database credentials to the `.env` file (sample provided as `.env.example`).
   - Example `.env` file:
     ```env
     KNOWLEDGE_BASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
     ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:** Ensure that your input data conforms to the expected format. Check `docs/data_format.md` for details.
